# License guide for content

This is a _very simple_ guide to licenses. If you don't know anything about licenses you can use this to make the decision easier.
This is not meant as a rule, choose the license that you feel is appropriate for your work. Period.

## MIT

The [**MIT** license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) is often used for code or declarative config. It is a very permissive license that allows other people to do a lot with it and is often choosen by authors here.

## (A/L)GPL
The biggest issues with the MIT license is that everybody can do almost everything with it. The [GPL license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) is a lot more restrictive in that. Particularly the right to earn money off the content is taken. This can be a big deal for you.

## CC-by-SA
[**CC-by-SA**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) is the MIT-like-license for the website design and any non-code related workshopper materials. It is basically the same as the MIT license but not [OSI approved](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).
